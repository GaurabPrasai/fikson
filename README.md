# Recom: A Movie Recommendation System

Recom is a machine learning-powered movie recommendation system designed to provide users with personalized movie suggestions based on their preferences. By utilizing advanced content-based filtering techniques and state-of-the-art tools, Recom ensures precise and relevant recommendations through a seamless and interactive interface.

## System Architecture

### 1. Machine Learning Model
Recom employs a **content-based filtering algorithm** that analyzes features such as genres, directors, actors, and plot summaries. Using **TF-IDF vectorization**, these features are transformed into numerical vectors, enabling precise similarity calculations via **cosine similarity**. This ensures the model identifies movies that closely match user preferences.

Key components:
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts raw movie metadata into structured numerical data.
- **Similarity Analysis**: Measures the closeness of movies based on feature vectors.

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(movie_vectors)
```

### 2. Web Application
The web interface, built with **Streamlit**, allows users to input their favorite movies and receive instant recommendations. Streamlitâ€™s intuitive framework enables rapid prototyping and deployment of interactive features.

Example usage:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 3. Model Serialization
The trained machine learning model is serialized using **Pickle**, ensuring fast and efficient deployment. This eliminates the need for retraining during runtime.

```python
import pickle
# Save model
pickle.dump(model, open('model.pkl', 'wb'))
# Load model
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
```

## Features

1. **Real-Time Recommendations**: Delivers instant movie suggestions based on user input.
2. **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture facilitates easy updates and future enhancements.
3. **Optimized Performance**: Lightweight application optimized for quick response times.
